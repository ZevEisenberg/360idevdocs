This is entirely taken from or based on, this [awesome resource](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports). This is by now means exactly how any and every incident will go down, but we thought it best to outline the process we'd take.

__If we receive a report of harassment, this is what will happen.__

 - We'll immediately find a private place where we can get a full account of the report from the reporting party.
 - We'll want to know:
 	- Who the offending party is
	- what was said or done 
	- any and all circumstances around the incident
	- anyone else involved or witnessing the incident.
	- When and where the incident took place

__What we'll do next__

 - Address the harassing party, letting them know we've received a complaint, and hear their side of the story.
 - We'll convene a meeting of staff (John & Nicole) and a small group of advisers
	 - This will happen as soon as possible
 - Decide what our response will be.
 	- Response will vary but could be anywhere from warning to removal from event, to lifetime ban on event, or something in between. It will depend on the specific incident.
 - We'll address the issue with the attendees, letting them know something happened, that it violated our code of conduct policies and we took X action.
 
This page, as well as our Code of Conduct are very much works in progress, and will evolve as the community, the conferences evolve.

If you have any questions, or suggestions for this page or the CoC, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
