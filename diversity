We value diversity in the communities we bring together, and we welcome your contributions to bringing balanced representation of the richness of our collective human experience.   Diversity for tech events is an incredibly important issue. For conference organizers, balancing the need for high quality content with the need for diversity can be challenging. We understand that saying we want diversity isn’t enough, which is why we actively network to encourage a variety of people not traditionally represented to submit talks.

For 360|Conferences, we feel strongly that this active approach to diversity is best. We’re constantly looking to build professional relationships with the kind of tech talent that is not traditionally represented. We feel that some other solutions, such as giving certain groups free passes to the conference, is counterproductive. While well meaning, they don’t address the underlying issue - which is the tendency of the traditional tech crowd to talk to itself while organizing conferences.

We strongly encourage anyone to submit speaking topics. And if you have any concerns or suggestion on how we can do better, do not hesitate to reach out to us at john@360conferences.com. We understand how incredibly important this issue is.
